### Task Description:

#2
We like to know more about our employees. So in the employee schema we need to store the employee starting date, current salary, favourite color and desired salary.

Update the schema with those datas and also don’t forget about populate.js for add some initial data.

In the frontend update the table to show this data in this format:
Starting date to be a string locally formatted.
Salary and desired salary is a string also formatted locally
Show the difference between salary and desired also formatted locally.
Favourite color as an actual color. So for example change the td background color to a selected favourite color.
	
Also update the create and edit forms. The starting date has to be a date input. The salaries has to be a number fields and the color has to be a color picker.
