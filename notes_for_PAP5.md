### Task Description:

#5
Extend the database so that we can store “tools”. Each tool has a name and a weight (in kg). Add the following tools to the database
{ "name": "Notebook", "weight": 0.5 },
{ "name": "Pencil", "weight": 0.06 },
{ "name": "Pen", "weight": 0.12 },
{ "name": "Book", "weight": 1 }

Add a new page to the site at the route "/tools" that lists all tools (show the name and weight of each tool). This page should also have a text input field using which the user can filter based on the name of the tool.

Add two more inputs; one for the name and one for the weight. Also add a button. When clicking on the button, a new tool with the given name and weight should be created in the database.
